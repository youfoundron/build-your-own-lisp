  EXC_ARITHMETIC is signaled when the CPU detects an invalid calculation.
  Some causes include division by 0 (our case), integer overflow, etc.
  Unix signal SIGFPE causes a core dump and a program exit. The name "FPE", standing for floating-point exception, is a misnomer as the signal covers integer-arithmetic errors as well.

› How do you give an enum a name?
  Syntax to define an enumerated data type:
  enum type_name{ value1, value2,...,valueN };

  If passed, the type_name is the name of the enumerated data type or tag.

› What are union data types and how do they work?
  Unions are declared, created, and used the same as structs except
  unions only allocate enough space to store the largest field listed,
  and all fields are stored at the same space (the beginning of the union).

  This means that all fields in a union share the same space,
  which can be used for any listed field but not more than one of them.

  In order to know which union fi9eld is actually stored, unions are often nested inside of structs,
  with an enumerated type indicating what is actually stored there.
  For Example:

  typedef struct Flight {
    enum { PASSENGER, CARGO } type;
    union {
      int npassengers;
      double tonnages;  // Units are not necessarily tons.
    } cargo;
  } Flight;

  Flight flights[ 1000 ];

› What are the advantages over using a union instead of struct?
  Unions allocate only enough bite size to store the largest field listed
  and all fields are stored in the same space -- the beginning of the union.
  This saves space, opposed to using a struct which allocates space for each field listed.
